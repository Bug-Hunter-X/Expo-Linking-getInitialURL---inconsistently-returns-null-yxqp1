This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link was opened, leading to unexpected behavior in your app. This is particularly problematic in Android, where it's more likely to occur than on iOS.
